Smart Phone application to measure Vital Parameters

We developed a smartphone application using React Native to measure the vital parameters such as heart rate and breathing rate of a person using his/her facial video.
To predict the values accurately we used an algorithm called EVM ( Eulerian video Magnification ). The Application also shows the normal and abnormal range and also provides clinical suggestion and redirects user to an appropriate page to consult a doctor or a medical insurance company.
